I live in Sogndal(Norway) and work as a IT-advisor for Vestland County Council in Norway.

I started my career as an IT apprentice back in 2003 and have from that day been a Microsoft fanboy - and I have been
working my way to become a Microsoft Certified professional within Microsoft 365, Azure in addition to onpremises products.

### My story

Living in the beautiful western part of Norway sorounded with high montains and deep fjords gives me a easy way to
disconnect from the rest of the world. During the winter season you will find me deep in the riding snow powder above the treelimits
on randonee skiing, and during summer times you will definetly catch me on my bikecykle, kayaking or taking mountain runs.
